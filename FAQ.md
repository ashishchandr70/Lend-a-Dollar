# FAQ – Why Not Just Donate?

### Why not just build a donation platform?

Donations help — but they don’t scale trust or agency well.

Loans:
- Preserve dignity  
- Reinforce agency  
- Encourage sustainability  
- Allow funds to recycle  
- Avoid savior dynamics  

The intent is not extraction — it is **mutual support with accountability**.

### Isn’t lending to poor people unethical?

Predatory lending is unethical.  
Low-interest, community-backed lending with capped losses and no collections is ethically different.

The goal is to remove harm, not introduce it.

---

### What if borrowers don’t repay?

That is an accepted risk.  
Losses are capped per lender.  
No collections or harassment occur.

This is impact-first lending, not profit-maximizing finance.

### Why use blockchain at all?

- Transparency  
- Public auditability  
- Shared trust infrastructure  

If blockchain adds more friction than value, it should be reconsidered.

### Won’t this attract scammers?

Yes — any system involving money does.  
That is why identity verification, AI-assisted review, and manual oversight are part of the design.

This project prioritizes safety over growth.

### Isn’t this just DeFi with a feel-good wrapper?

No.

DeFi optimizes for yield.  
This optimizes for harm reduction.

If incentives ever distort that balance, the design should be reconsidered.
