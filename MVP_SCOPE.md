# Lend-a-Dollar — No-Money MVP Scope

## Purpose

The No-Money MVP exists to validate:
- Product design
- Borrower dignity principles
- User experience (UX)
- Operational flows
- Governance concepts
- Transparency mechanisms

This phase is explicitly **not a financial product** and does not involve real money, real borrowers, or real compliance obligations.

The goal is to pressure-test design choices before any legal or operational commitment.

---

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- ❌ No real money  
- ❌ No stablecoins  
- ❌ No yield strategies  
- ❌ No real borrowers  
- ❌ No production KYC/AML  
- ❌ No real ACH / debit card rails  
- ❌ No production wallets  
- ❌ No storage of real SSNs or bank data  

All data is mock, anonymized, or synthetic.

## In Scope

### 1. Borrower Experience (Simulated)
- Borrower onboarding UX  
- Identity verification flow (mocked)  
- Document submission (fake documents)  
- AI-assisted underwriting (simulated outputs)  
- Loan approval / denial UX  
- Repayment option generation (inflation-linked logic simulated)  
- Loan acceptance flow  
- Repayment schedule preview  
- Dignity-aligned copy and language  

### 2. Lender Experience (Simulated)
- Lender onboarding UX  
- Identity verification flow (mocked)  
- Deposit flow (fake balances)  
- Pool participation UX  
- Exposure limits UI  
- Yield visualization (clearly labeled as simulated)  
- Impact dashboard (stories, metrics, transparency)  

### 3. Platform Admin Experience
- Manual override flows  
- Write-off simulation  
- Pause / kill-switch UX  
- Borrower appeals UX  
- Flag review UX  
- Compliance placeholder views  
- Audit logs (simulated)  

### 4. Governance (Mock)
- Proposal creation UX  
- Voting UI  
- Parameter changes (simulated only)  
- Display of how decisions would affect system behavior  

### 5. Transparency & Reporting
- Loan lifecycle visualization  
- Pool health dashboard  
- Write-off reporting  
- Ethical metrics (e.g., harm signals, appeals rate)  
- Public transparency view (fake data)

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Deferred)

- ❌ Smart contract deployment  
- ❌ Mainnet or testnet integration  
- ❌ Real payment processing  
- ❌ Real KYC vendors  
- ❌ Stablecoin custody  
- ❌ Yield strategy integration  
- ❌ Regulatory filings  
- ❌ Production security hardening  
- ❌ Performance scaling  
- ❌ Monetization logic  

---

## Success Criteria

The No-Money MVP is considered successful if:

- Borrowers can understand loan terms without assistance  
- Repayment options feel humane and realistic  
- UX reflects Borrower Dignity principles  
- Contributors can critique flows meaningfully  
- Ethical principles can be mapped to UI decisions  
- Architecture supports later compliance layering  
- Failure paths (denial, write-off, pause) feel respectful  

---

## Review Gates

Before moving beyond the No-Money MVP:

- Ethics review passed  
- UX review passed  
- Legal feasibility for Texas pilot assessed  
- Compliance burden estimated  
- Go / No-Go decision documented  

---

## Non-Goals

This MVP is **not** intended to:

- Validate revenue  
- Test market demand  
- Simulate yield performance  
- Onboard real users  
- Handle real funds  
- Replace legal diligence  

This phase exists to validate whether the design is **worthy of becoming real**.

---

## Exit Criteria

Proceed to legal structuring and pilot planning only if:

- Borrower dignity principles hold up under UX pressure  
- Repayment mechanics do not feel coercive  
- Ethical commitments remain enforceable  
- The team is comfortable with the compliance burden implied by real deployment
