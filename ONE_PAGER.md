# Lend-a-Dollar – Product One-Pager

## Problem

Millions of people face short-term financial emergencies.  
When banks say no, the remaining options are often payday lenders charging predatory interest rates that trap people in debt cycles.

People without family or community safety nets are hit the hardest.

---

## Solution

Lend-a-Dollar proposes a **community micro-lending pool**:

Instead of one person lending $1,000,  
100 people lend $10 each.

This spreads risk, lowers emotional burden, and enables people to help without risking financial harm to themselves.

- Low-income individuals
- People in short-term crisis
