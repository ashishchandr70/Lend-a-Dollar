# Lend-a-Dollar — Texas Pilot (Design & Feasibility Phase)

## Purpose

This document outlines a Texas-focused pilot for Lend-a-Dollar during the design and feasibility phase.  
The pilot is **non-financial** (no real money, no real borrowers) and exists to validate:

- Borrower dignity principles in practice  
- Humane repayment UX  
- AI-assisted underwriting flows with human oversight  
- Legal feasibility of operating as a lender in Texas  
- Operational workflows for a small, bounded pilot  

---

## Why Texas

- Large, diverse population  
- High prevalence of payday and title lending  
- Real-world regulatory environment for consumer lending  
- Local community context for impact evaluation  

---

## Scope (No-Money MVP Only)

- Simulated borrower onboarding (Texas residents)  
- Simulated lender participation  
- Mock identity verification  
- AI-assisted underwriting (simulated)  
- Repayment option generation UX  
- Transparency dashboard  
- Appeals and write-off UX  
- Governance mock  

---

## Success Criteria

- Borrowers understand terms without assistance  
- Repayment options feel humane and realistic  
- UX encodes dignity principles  
- Legal requirements for Texas pilot are clearly mapped  
- Ethical risks and failure modes are documented  
- A go/no-go decision framework is produced
