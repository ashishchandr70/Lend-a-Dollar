## Principles for Borrower Dignity

Lend-a-Dollar exists to reduce harm during moments of financial vulnerability.  
These principles are non-negotiable design constraints. If any future feature violates them, the feature should not ship.

### 1. Dignity Over Extraction
Borrowers are not revenue streams.  
Financial distress must never be exploited for profit.

All economic design choices must prioritize borrower wellbeing over platform growth or yield optimization.

---

### 2. No Shame, No Coercion
Borrowers should never be shamed, threatened, or coerced into repayment.

There are:
- No harassment-based collections  
- No intimidation tactics  
- No punitive language  
- No dark UX patterns that pressure borrowers  

Repayment is encouraged, not enforced through fear.

---

### 3. Transparency in Plain Language
Loan terms, fees, interest, and consequences must be:

- Simple  
- Clear  
- Visible before acceptance  
- Understandable without legal or financial training  

If a borrower cannot easily explain the loan terms to a friend, the design is too complex.

---

### 4. Right to Exit Without Ruin
Loans must be designed so borrowers can realistically exit debt.

This includes:
- No rollover traps  
- No compounding penalty structures  
- No mechanisms that intentionally keep borrowers in debt  

If a borrower’s situation worsens, write-offs are an accepted outcome.

---

### 5. Proportional Consequences
Failure to repay should not trigger catastrophic outcomes.

There is:
- No asset seizure  
- No wage garnishment  
- No credit score punishment (where avoidable)  

The system absorbs loss so borrowers are not permanently damaged by temporary hardship.

---

### 6. Privacy & Respect for Personal Data
Borrowers entrust the platform with sensitive personal and financial information.

This data must be:
- Collected only when necessary  
- Used only for eligibility and safety  
- Never sold  
- Never used for manipulation or profiling  

AI systems must be explainable and auditable.

---

### 7. Right to Explanation & Appeal
Borrowers deserve to understand decisions that affect them.

- Automated decisions must be explainable  
- Borrowers can appeal rejections  
- Human review is available  
- No “black box” denial of assistance  

Opacity in moments of crisis is dehumanizing.

---

### 8. Design for Recovery, Not Dependency
The platform should help borrowers stabilize — not become dependent on repeat borrowing.

Design choices should:
- Discourage habitual borrowing  
- Encourage long-term stability  
- Include cooling-off periods  
- Avoid gamification of borrowing  

Success is fewer loans over time, not more.

---

### 9. Respectful UX
The user experience must reflect empathy:

- No language that frames borrowers as risky or irresponsible  
- No stigmatizing copy  
- No predatory urgency tactics  
- No “gotcha” flows  

The UX should feel like support, not interrogation.

---

### 10. Continuous Dignity Review
Borrower dignity is not a one-time design decision.

- Metrics must track harm as well as success  
- User feedback must be incorporated  
- Ethical drift must trigger redesign  
- If incentives distort behavior, incentives must change  

> If a feature increases revenue but reduces dignity, the feature is wrong.

## Repayment Principles (Augmenting Borrower Dignity)

Repayment design is one of the most powerful ways a financial system can either preserve or erode dignity.  
Lend-a-Dollar commits to the following repayment principles:

### 1. Repayment is Agreed at the Moment of Help
All repayment terms are presented clearly and accepted at the time of loan acceptance.  
There are no surprise terms, retroactive changes, or hidden mechanics introduced after disbursement.

Borrowers know what they are agreeing to before they receive funds.

---

### 2. Ability-Aware Repayment Options
Repayment options must be aligned with the borrower’s demonstrated ability to pay.

The system must not offer repayment schedules that are mathematically unrealistic given a borrower’s income and obligations.

Borrowers should never be set up to fail.

---

### 3. Low, Non-Extractive Cost of Capital
Interest exists only to preserve value (e.g., inflation-linked) — not to extract profit from distress.

The platform must not benefit from prolonged borrower struggle.

---

### 4. Grace Before Accrual
Interest does not begin accruing immediately upon disbursement.

A short grace period exists to allow borrowers to stabilize after receiving funds, reinforcing that this system exists to reduce harm, not accelerate pressure.

---

### 5. No Coercive Repayment Mechanisms
Repayment rails (ACH, debit) must not become tools of silent coercion.

Borrowers must have:
- Visibility into upcoming debits  
- Ability to reschedule within reasonable limits  
- Access to pause requests during acute hardship  
- Human review when automation fails

Automation exists for convenience, not control.

---

### 6. Predictable, Simple Repayment Structures
Repayment schedules should be simple and understandable.

If a borrower cannot easily explain their repayment plan to another person, the structure is too complex.

---

### 7. Right to Explanation & Adjustment
Borrowers have the right to:
- Understand why certain repayment options were offered or excluded  
- Request a manual review  
- Adjust repayment schedules when life circumstances change  

Rigid systems dehumanize. Flexibility preserves dignity.

---

### 8. Failure is Not Moralized
If repayment fails, the system absorbs loss without shaming, harassment, or punishment.

Write-offs are an accepted outcome of compassionate risk-sharing, not a moral failure by the borrower.

---

### 9. Repayment Design Should Reduce Long-Term Dependency
The repayment model should support stabilization and exit, not recurring dependency.

Design choices should discourage habitual borrowing while preserving access for genuine short-term need.

---

### 10. Continuous Repayment Ethics Review
Repayment mechanics must be periodically reviewed to ensure they do not drift toward extractive dynamics.

If a repayment feature increases revenue but increases borrower harm or pressure, it must be redesigned or removed.
