# Lend-a-Dollar
This is a project in its ideation phase. It is centered around the idea that there are millions of people out there that are severely financially distressed, who have lost their jobs and are behind on their bills. This project seeks to build a platform that will enable people to help one another by lending a dollar at a time. 
Some random thoughts
- Hosted on a blockchain platform: that is the only way you ensure a voice for everyone involved and keep it fair
- Not for profit
- Band aid on a broken system. It is definitely not THE fix.

More to come...
