# Lend-a-Dollar – Roadmap

This roadmap reflects design intent, not commitments.  
The project is exploratory and will evolve based on feasibility, legal constraints, and community feedback.

---

## Phase 1 — Concept & Research (Current Phase)

- [x] Define vision and ethical boundaries  
- [x] Write README and guiding principles  
- [ ] Research legal constraints (US lending, KYC/AML, money transmission)  
- [ ] Define borrower eligibility framework  
- [ ] Define lender risk framework  
- [ ] Threat model: fraud, abuse, Sybil attacks  
- [ ] Document non-goals and constraints  

---

## Phase 2 — MVP Design (No Production Funds)

- [ ] UX flows for borrowers and lenders  
- [ ] Basic AI-assisted underwriting logic (design only)  
- [ ] Mock identity verification flow  
- [ ] Simulated lending pool (testnet / fake funds)  
- [ ] Simple governance mock (polling or votes)  
- [ ] Transparency dashboard mockups  

---

## Phase 3 — Prototype (Testnet Only)

- [ ] Smart contract design (escrow + pool logic)  
- [ ] Stablecoin handling logic (USDC testnet)  
- [ ] Repayment flows  
- [ ] Write-off logic  
- [ ] Fraud detection heuristics  
- [ ] Security review (informal)  

---

## Phase 4 — Legal Structuring

- [ ] Consult legal experts  
- [ ] Determine platform structure  
- [ ] Evaluate nonprofit vs for-profit vs hybrid  
- [ ] Compliance feasibility assessment  
- [ ] Decide go / no-go  

---

## Phase 5 — Controlled Pilot (If Legally Viable)

- [ ] Small closed beta  
- [ ] Hard caps on funds  
- [ ] Manual oversight  
- [ ] Real-world impact evaluation  
- [ ] Pause conditions & kill-switches  

---

## Phase 6 — Scale (Only If Phase 5 Is Healthy)

- [ ] Improve automation  
- [ ] Expand geography (if legal)  
- [ ] Governance rollout  
- [ ] Risk pooling refinements  
- [ ] External audits  

---

## Exit Criteria

The project should be paused or shut down if:

- Abuse exceeds benefit  
- Regulatory risk is too high  
- Incentives distort behavior  
- Borrowers are harmed  
- Trust erodes
