# Stories of Harm and What Could Be Different

The following are composite, anonymized scenarios based on common patterns in predatory lending and short-term financial distress.  
They are not real individuals. The goal is to illustrate structural harm and how alternative financial design could reduce that harm.

These examples are not promises of outcomes — they are thought experiments grounded in real-world dynamics.

## Story 1: Medical Bill Shock

**What Happened**

Amit had health insurance, but a sudden ER visit left him with a $1,100 out-of-pocket bill.  
He was already behind on utilities. The hospital offered a payment plan, but the first installment was due immediately.

With no savings and poor credit, Amit took out a short-term loan with high fees and a triple-digit APR.  
Within three months, the loan had ballooned due to rollovers and late fees.  
The financial stress worsened his health and led to skipped follow-up care.

**What Could Have Been Different with Lend-a-Dollar**

With access to a community micro-loan pool:
- Amit could have borrowed $1,100 funded by ~110 people lending $10 each  
- The loan would carry low, transparent interest  
- No compounding penalties  
- No harassment  
- If repayment became difficult, losses would be spread across many lenders instead of compounding against Amit  

This wouldn’t erase medical costs —  
but it could have prevented medical debt from turning into a debt spiral.

## Story 2: Eviction Threat

**What Happened**

Tanya worked hourly shifts and missed several days of work when her child got sick.  
Her rent was short by $850.

Her landlord issued a pay-or-quit notice.  
She took out a payday loan to avoid eviction.  
The loan covered rent — but the fees and rollover charges meant she was short again the following month.

She entered a cycle where each month’s loan created the next month’s shortfall.

**What Could Have Been Different with Lend-a-Dollar**

With access to micro-syndicated lending:
- Tanya could have borrowed $850 funded by many small lenders  
- No rollover traps  
- No predatory APR  
- No seizure of wages or assets  
- A structured, humane repayment plan  

The loan wouldn’t fix income volatility —  
but it could have bought time without compounding harm.

## Story 3: Gig Worker Cash Flow Volatility

**What Happened**

Carlos drove for multiple gig platforms.  
When his car needed repairs, he lost income for two weeks.  
He borrowed $900 from a title lender to fix the car.

The interest and fees were so high that he couldn’t catch up.  
He fell behind on payments and eventually lost his car — which eliminated his income source entirely.

**What Could Have Been Different with Lend-a-Dollar**

With access to a pooled micro-loan:
- No collateral seizure  
- No compounding fees  
- No asset forfeiture  
- Low, transparent interest  
- Temporary financial relief without catastrophic downside  

This would not remove gig economy volatility —  
but it could prevent one short disruption from cascading into job loss.

## Why These Stories Matter

Predatory lending extracts value from people at their most vulnerable moments.

Lend-a-Dollar is designed to reduce harm during those moments by:

- Lowering cost of capital  
- Avoiding debt traps  
- Spreading risk across community  
- Preserving dignity  
- Creating breathing room instead of compounding pressure  

These stories exist to remind us that financial design choices shape real lives.
