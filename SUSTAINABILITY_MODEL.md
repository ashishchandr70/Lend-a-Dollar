# Lend-a-Dollar — Sustainability Model

This document explains how Lend-a-Dollar sustains operations without extracting from borrowers or misusing lender principal.

> **Core principle:** Borrower principal is ring-fenced. Platform operations and reserves are funded from yield and grants — never from principal.

---

## Two-Sleeve Structure (Ring-Fenced Principal)

**All lender funds (100%)** are split into two sleeves:

1) **Active Lending Pool (70–80%) — Principal, protected**  
- Deployed directly to borrowers.  
- Liquidity reserved for borrower needs.  
- **Never used for platform ops or reserves.**

2) **Yield Sleeve (20–30%) — Lender-owned & withdrawable**  
- Deployed in transparent, conservative yield strategies (target ~5% gross, subject to market risk and compliance).  
- **Capital remains lender-owned and withdrawable at any time.**  
- The platform does not own this capital.

> Lenders explicitly opt into their allocation mix within guardrails (e.g., minimum 70% to lending).

## How Yield Is Used (Never Principal)

**Only the yield generated by the Yield Sleeve** is split transparently:

- **Platform Operations (A% of yield)**  
- **Lender Incentives (B% of yield)**  
- **Resilience Reserve (C% of yield)**  

> Guardrail: **Ops + Reserve are funded from yield and grants only. Principal is never touched.**

---

## Phased Funding (No Perverse Incentives)

**Phase 0–2 (Build/Pilot):**  
- Platform ops funded primarily by **grants/philanthropy**.  
- Yield share contributes modestly; reserve begins to form.

**Phase 3+ (Scale):**  
- Yield share covers a growing portion of ops.  
- Optional lender services + partnerships supplement ops.  
- Grants taper as scale increases.

---

## Resilience Reserve Policy (Target-Based, Capped)

- Purpose: absorb write-offs, cover shocks, protect borrower dignity.  
- Target (initial options; to be governed publicly):
  - 3–6 months of expected write-offs, **or**
  - 5–10% of outstanding principal, **or**
  - X months of ops buffer (yield-funded only).
- Reserve accumulation **caps** at target; excess yield flows back to lenders or reduces future borrower costs.

---

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails

- ❌ No borrower platform fees  
- ❌ No compounding late fees / rollovers  
- ❌ No monetizing collections or defaults  
- ❌ No selling borrower data  
- ✅ Transparent dashboards for yield allocation & reserve status  
- ✅ Underwriting insulated from ops funding pressure

---

## Why This Is Not “Shortchanging” Borrowers or Lenders

- The **20–30% Yield Sleeve belongs to lenders**, not the platform.  
- Lenders opt into the allocation; capital remains withdrawable.  
- This design **prevents borrower fees** and extractive practices by funding ops from yield + grants.  
- Without a sustainability layer, the platform would either extract from borrowers, accept VC pressure, or fail to exist.

## Summary

Lend-a-Dollar sustains itself via:
- Grants (early phases),
- Yield-sharing from a lender-owned Yield Sleeve,
- Optional lender services and ethical partnerships (later).

**Borrower principal is ring-fenced. Only yield funds ops and the resilience reserve.**
