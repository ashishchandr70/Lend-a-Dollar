# Lend-a-Dollar — Sustainability Model

This document explains how the Lend-a-Dollar platform sustains its operations over time without creating extractive incentives for borrowers.

The core design principle is:

> The platform must never profit from borrower distress.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Borrowers are not charged platform fees.
- The platform does not profit from defaults.
- The platform does not use coercive collections or harassment.
- Revenue sources must align with borrower dignity.
- Sustainability mechanisms must not distort underwriting decisions.
- Incentives must be aligned with long-term borrower stability, not short-term yield.

---

## Phased Funding Model

### Phase 0–1: Build & Pilot (Grant-Funded)

Early phases of Lend-a-Dollar are funded by grants and philanthropic capital.  
This funds:

- MVP development  
- Legal and regulatory research  
- UX validation and user research  
- Pilot program operations  
- Founder and core contributor runway  

Grants fund the existence of the platform, not the loan capital itself.

---

### Phase 2+: Operational Sustainability (Post-Pilot)

Once live, platform sustainability shifts to non-extractive revenue sources.

#### 1. Yield-Sharing (Primary Sustainability Layer)

Idle pooled funds may be deployed into conservative, low-risk yield strategies (e.g., yield-bearing stablecoins or similar instruments, subject to regulatory compliance).

Yield is allocated transparently:

- A portion to lenders (incentive for participation)
- A small portion to platform operations
- A small portion to a resilience reserve

The platform only earns when funds are productively deployed, not when borrowers struggle.

---

#### 2. Optional Lender Services (Non-Extractive)

Lenders may opt into paid services such as:

- Advanced transparency dashboards  
- Portfolio insights  
- Impact reporting  
- Governance tooling  
- Compliance or tax documentation (where applicable)  

These services are optional and not required to participate in lending.

---

#### 3. Partnerships & Grants (Ongoing)

The platform may continue to pursue:

- Research grants  
- Civic tech grants  
- Financial inclusion grants  
- Ethical fintech partnerships  

These funds are used for:

- Continued product improvement  
- Compliance and audit costs  
- Community education  
- Borrower support resources  

---

## Resilience Reserve

A small portion of yield is allocated to a resilience reserve.

Purpose:

- Absorb loan write-offs  
- Cover operational shortfalls  
- Fund borrower support resources  
- Reduce pressure to extract repayments  

This reserve exists to protect borrower dignity during systemic shocks.

---

## Hard Guardrails (Non-Negotiables)

The platform will not:

- Charge borrower-facing platform fees  
- Charge rollover fees  
- Charge compounding late fees  
- Monetize collections  
- Sell borrower data  
- Use borrower distress as a revenue source  

The platform must never be financially incentivized by default or hardship.

---

## Governance & Oversight

Platform governance mechanisms may:

- Adjust yield allocation ratios  
- Set caps on platform revenue  
- Approve or reject new sustainability mechanisms  
- Enforce borrower dignity guardrails  

Governance must prioritize dignity over growth.

---

## How This Differs From Predatory Lending

| Predatory Lending | Lend-a-Dollar |
|-------------------|---------------|
Revenue grows when borrowers fail | Revenue is decoupled from borrower failure  
High fees, rollovers, compounding interest | Inflation-linked value preservation  
Coercive collections | Support-first repayment design  
Opaque pricing | Transparent, plain-language terms  
Profit maximization | Harm minimization + dignity  

---

## Summary

Lend-a-Dollar sustains itself through:

- Grants (early phase)  
- Yield-sharing (aligned incentives)  
- Optional lender services  
- Ethical partnerships  

The platform’s survival must never depend on borrower suffering.
