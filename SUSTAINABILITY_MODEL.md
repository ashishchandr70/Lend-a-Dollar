# Lend-a-Dollar — Sustainability Model

This document explains how Lend-a-Dollar sustains operations without extracting from borrowers or misusing lender principal.

> **Core principle:** Borrower principal is ring-fenced. Platform operations and reserves are funded from yield and grants — never from principal.

---

## Two-Sleeve Structure (Ring-Fenced Principal)

**All lender funds (100%)** are split into two sleeves:

1) **Active Lending Pool (70–80%) — Principal, protected**  
- Deployed directly to borrowers.  
- Liquidity reserved for borrower needs.  
- **Never used for platform ops or reserves.**

2) **Yield Sleeve (20–30%) — Lender-owned & withdrawable**  
- Deployed in transparent, conservative yield strategies (target ~5% gross, subject to market risk and compliance).  
- **Capital remains lender-owned and withdrawable at any time.**  
- The platform does not own this capital.

> Lenders explicitly opt into their allocation mix within guardrails (e.g., minimum 70% to lending).

## How Yield Is Used (Never Principal)

**Only the yield generated by the Yield Sleeve** is split transparently:

- **Platform Operations (A% of yield)**  
- **Lender Incentives (B% of yield)**  
- **Resilience Reserve (C% of yield)**  

> Guardrail: **Ops + Reserve are funded from yield and grants only. Principal is never touched.**

---

## Phased Funding (No Perverse Incentives)

**Phase 0–2 (Build/Pilot):**  
- Platform ops funded primarily by **grants/philanthropy**.  
- Yield share contributes modestly; reserve begins to form.

**Phase 3+ (Scale):**  
- Yield share covers a growing portion of ops.  
- Optional lender services + partnerships supplement ops.  
- Grants taper as scale increases.

---

## Resilience Reserve Policy (Target-Based, Capped)

- Purpose: absorb write-offs, cover shocks, protect borrower dignity.  
- Target (initial options; to be governed publicly):
  - 3–6 months of expected write-offs, **or**
  - 5–10% of outstanding principal, **or**
  - X months of ops buffer (yield-funded only).
- Reserve accumulation **caps** at target; excess yield flows back to lenders or reduces future borrower costs.

---

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails

- ❌ No borrower platform fees  
- ❌ No compounding late fees / rollovers  
- ❌ No monetizing collections or defaults  
- ❌ No selling borrower data  
- ✅ Transparent dashboards for yield allocation & reserve status  
- ✅ Underwriting insulated from ops funding pressure

---

## Why This Is Not “Shortchanging” Borrowers or Lenders

- The **20–30% Yield Sleeve belongs to lenders**, not the platform.  
- Lenders opt into the allocation; capital remains withdrawable.  
- This design **prevents borrower fees** and extractive practices by funding ops from yield + grants.  
- Without a sustainability layer, the platform would either extract from borrowers, accept VC pressure, or fail to exist.

---
## Borrower Interest Allocation (Inflation-Linked, Non-Extractive)

Borrower interest is inflation-linked and exists solely to preserve the real value of funds lent.  
**100% of borrower interest is recycled back into the Active Lending Pool** to support future borrowers.

- Borrower interest is **never** used to fund platform operations.
- Borrower interest is **not** used to pay lender incentives.
- This prevents any incentive to prolong borrower indebtedness and ensures interest functions as community replenishment, not extraction.

**Principle:** Borrower interest preserves community lending capacity; platform sustainability is funded by yield and grants.

---

## How Yield Is Used (Never Principal, Never Borrower Interest)

Only the **yield generated by the Yield Sleeve** is split transparently:

- **Platform Operations (A% of yield)**
- **Lender Incentives (B% of yield)**
- **Resilience Reserve (C% of yield)**

Guardrail: **Ops + Reserve are funded from yield and grants only. Borrower interest and principal are never used for ops.**
---
## Summary

Lend-a-Dollar sustains itself via:
- Grants (early phases),
- Yield-sharing from a lender-owned Yield Sleeve,
- Optional lender services and ethical partnerships (later).

**Borrower principal is ring-fenced. Only yield funds ops and the resilience reserve.**

# Lend-a-Dollar — Sustainability FAQ

### Are borrowers being shortchanged if 20–30% of lender funds go to yield strategies?
No. That portion belongs to lenders and is allocated by lender choice. Borrower principal (70–80%) is ring-fenced and never used for platform ops. The yield sleeve exists to fund operations without charging borrowers.

### Does the platform take lender capital?
No. The platform never takes principal. Only **yield** (returns generated) is used for ops, lender incentives, and the resilience reserve. Yield sleeve capital remains lender-owned and withdrawable.

### Why not deploy 100% to lending?
Without a sustainability layer, the platform would need borrower fees or extractive practices to survive. The yield sleeve is a transparent way to keep the platform alive **without taxing borrowers**.

### Can lenders choose their allocation?
Yes. Lenders choose their mix within guardrails (e.g., minimum 70% to lending). Example profiles: Conservative (90/10), Balanced (75/25), Platform-supporter (70/30).

### What is the resilience reserve?
A yield-funded buffer to absorb write-offs and shocks so borrowers aren’t pressured and collections aren’t coercive. The reserve has a public target and a cap.

### Does ops funding affect underwriting?
No. Governance and technical guardrails prevent ops funding needs from influencing underwriting decisions.

### Where does the interest paid by borrowers go?
All borrower interest (inflation-linked) is **recycled into the Active Lending Pool** to help future borrowers.  
It is **not** used to fund platform operations and **not** paid out as lender incentives. This prevents any incentive to keep borrowers in debt.

### How is the platform funded if borrower interest isn’t used?
Platform operations are funded by:
- Grants (early phases),
- A transparent share of **yield** from the Yield Sleeve,
- Optional lender services and ethical partnerships (later).
Borrower principal and borrower interest are ring-fenced from ops.

### What happens in early phases before yield is meaningful?
Operations are funded primarily by **grants/philanthropy**. Yield contributes modestly until scale is reached.
